    question: "A shopkeeper marks the price of an article 50% above the cost price and then allows a discount of 20%. What is the profit percentage?",
    options: ["20%", "25%", "30%", "15%"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Let CP = 100. Marked Price = 150. After 20% discount, SP = 150 × 0.8 = 120. Profit = 20, Profit% = 20%",
    shortcut: "Use formula: Profit% = (Mark-up% - Discount%) - (Mark-up% × Discount%)/100 = 50 - 20 - 10 = 20%",

    question: "A can complete a work in 12 days, B in 15 days. They work together for 4 days, then A leaves. How many more days will B take to finish the remaining work?",
    options: ["5 days", "6 days", "7 days", "8 days"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "A's 1 day work = 1/12, B's 1 day work = 1/15. Together in 4 days = 4(1/12 + 1/15) = 4(9/60) = 3/5. Remaining = 2/5. B alone takes (2/5)/(1/15) = 6 days",
    shortcut: "Use LCM method: Total work = 60 units. A = 5 units/day, B = 4 units/day. Together = 9 × 4 = 36. Remaining = 24. B takes 24/4 = 6 days",

      "Neither the manager nor the employees has been present.",
      "Neither the manager nor the employees are present.",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "In 'neither...nor' constructions, the verb agrees with the nearest subject. 'Employees' is plural, so 'were' is correct.",

    question: "A bag contains 5 red, 4 blue, and 3 green balls. If 2 balls are drawn at random, what is the probability that both are of different colors?",
    options: ["47/66", "19/66", "41/66", "25/66"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "Total balls = 12. P(same color) = C(5,2) + C(4,2) + C(3,2) / C(12,2) = (10+6+3)/66 = 19/66. P(different) = 1 - 19/66 = 47/66",
