    shortcut: 'P(A|B) = [P(A)+P(B)-P(A∪B)] / P(B) = 0.2/0.5 = 0.4',

    question: 'A bag has 6 red, 4 blue, 2 green balls. 3 balls are drawn. Find P(one of each color).',
    options: ['12/55', '18/55', '24/55', '30/55'],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Favorable = C(6,1)×C(4,1)×C(2,1) = 48. Total = C(12,3) = 220. P = 48/220 = 12/55',

    options: ['1/6', '11/72', '7/36', '13/72'],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'P = P(H)×P(6|H) + P(T)×P(sum 6|T) = (1/2)(1/6) + (1/2)(5/36) = 1/12 + 5/72 = 6/72 + 5/72 = 11/72',

    options: ['4/11', '7/11', '8/11', '9/11'],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Letters: M=1, I=4, S=4, P=2. Repeated >2 times: I and S (4 each). P = (4+4)/11 = 8/11',
